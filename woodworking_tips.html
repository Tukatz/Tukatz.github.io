        <h3>Epoxy Removal</h3>
        <p>While working on a table project I accidentally got a spot of 30 minute Epoxy on my saw table and had some squeeze-out on the wood. It happened to be winter wheer I live and my lacquer thinner, Acetone and most other chemicals were in outside storage. I didn't feel like walking through snow in my shop shoes to get these so I experimented with another product I had in my shop.</p>
        <p>I put a dab of "Omni" automotive enamel reducer on a rag and in seconds had removed the epoxy from both my saw table and the wood. There are a number of Omni reducers as well as other brands but I suspect they will all work for this purpose. They probably should be stored in a fireproof metal cabinet or in an out building. I admit I am not perfect... except to my wife :) but in retrospect, I realize oversights like this (keeping volatile chemicals indoors) is not wize! </p>
    
        <h3>C/A Glue</h3>
        <p>I use a variety of glues in woodworking. One of my favourite products is C/A glue (Cyano Acrylate) I prefer the "Super Thin" variety. This is instant glue often referred to as "Crazy Glue" however I use a stronger grade of the product. There are pro's and con's to working with C/A glue, here are a few things I have learned about it:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Never get it on your skin!</b> If you do, the first thing you touch including yourself will become firmly bonded to you! (been there, done that!) There is a de-bonder available which you can use to free yourself or to separate unintentionally glued items in the event it happens, I.E: if you glue your fingers together.</li>
                <li>De-bonder does not work instantly, it takes a few minutes of working it in to the glued surface or to let it soak in as in the case of wood. You can use latex or nitrile gloves when using C/A, but this can be a bit clumsy.<b> Careful handling is a must!</b></li>
                <li>C/A glue is both Anhydrous and Anerobic which means it reacts with water and works when the air is removed. If for instance you are gluing two pieces of wood together, you need a perfect fit. You apply the C/A to the edge of the joint and it wicks in and generally sets immediately. If the wood is extremely dry it may need the help of some Accelerator, or you could very slightly moisten the 2 surfaces with water. <b> Over applying C/A does not help or make a better bond.</b></li>
                <li>The reaction in the gluing process produces heat as evidenced by a small amount of white smoke or vapor. It is best not to breathe in the fumes since they cause a burning sensation in your eyes. The reaction in your nose and throat is also unpleasant however C/A is apparently non-toxic and non-poisonous. C/A glue is sometimes used in place of sutures in operations. I cannot verify if there is any difference in C/A's used in medical situations as opposed to wood working.</li>
                <li>C/A glues come in a variety of types: there is the Super Thin which I commonly use, there are thick ones for use where there are small gaps, C/A's for synthetic materials, rubber, extruded foam and so on. I have found the thick variety does not keep as well as the Super thin. I will explain further.</li>
                <li>C/A super thin &amp; thick C/A work well with wood, leather and fabrics BUT they attack foam products and some synthetics. They do not work well with Plexiglas, sheet Acrylics or other plastics. For Plexiglas and some hard plastics you will need a "Thermo-Acrylic" cement such as "IPS # 16 Clear medium bodied Acrylic Solvent Cement as mentioned in "Tool Tips". This glue however does not work with Nylon plastics or the type of plastic that has a greasy feeling. Plastics come under the term "Polymers" and there are many varieties.</li>
                <li>The thing I like about C/A glue is in applications where clamps are awkward or simply cannot be used, there C/A really shines! As for overall strength, C/A is fairly good but in some cases, either 2 part epoxy or Polyurethane glue is better.</li>
                <li>Oily woods such as Cedar are difficult to glue. You CAN try wiping the surface with a dry thinner such as Acetone, Lacquer thinner or a similar product to remove some of the surface oil before applying glue. <b>Remember to either soak your rags used with thinners in water or dispose of them either in a covered steel container or simply hang them outside to dry.</b> Spontaneous combustion is NOT a desirable situation!</li>
                <li>I use a fair bit of C/A glue, I buy it in 8 Oz. containers rather than the small bottles you may find in hardware, lumber stores, or hobby shops. There are a number of brands of C/A products available but the only one I know of that sells it in 8 Oz quantities is Bob Smith Industries. They also sell disposable applicators. I don't know that they retail the product so you would have to find a distributor that handles it. I buy mine from KMS Tools Ltd. You can find them on the Internet and they do ship anywhere in N. America.</li>
                <li>I find the smaller containers tend to plug up in the tip and eventually go hard. Also it is more cost effective to buy the products in 8 Oz quantities. C/A products stored at room temperature do not have an overly long shelf life, The good news is that they keep well in your freezer without affecting quality. You can use the super thin variety straight out of the freezer. The thick version does not keep as long even in the freezer as the super thin, only perhaps about a year whereas the super thin will keep easily 2 or more years! Be sure to keep the cap clean, make sure it is on tight and do not leave the cap off the bottle for extended periods, C/A's will eventually react to humidity in the air.</li>
                <li>As for applying the product, I purchase a quantity of the applicators every so often so I always have some on hand. If you keep the tips of the applicators free of C/A, they can often be re-used a number of times. They come in several tip sizes which is handy depending on the job and type of C/A being used. They are fairly cheap and make using the product straight out of the large containers easy.</li>
                <li>If you have small cracks or gaps between end or side joints you can simply fill the gaps with fine sawdust and apply a few drops of C/A Super Thin. It hardens immediately without needing the accelerator and maked a pretty good filler which can be power sanded or filed. Just remember never to get wet C/A in contact with your sander's rubber base, It eats rubber!</li>

        </p>
    
        <h3>Polyurethane Glues</h3>
        <p>Another glue I occasionally use in woodworking is LePage PL Premium 3X. It is waterproof and in cases where the wood is porous or perhaps has less than perfect joinery, this is a handy glue. It does expand especially when in contact with wet wood which actually gives a stronger bond. When joining pieces it is best to dampen the gluing surfaces, apply 3X sparingly and clamp the pieces tightly to prevent movement and to ensure maximum bonding strength. Squeeze-out can be trimmed when fully cured with a sharp chisel. <mark class="highlight">Rubber gloves are a must</mark> as any Polyurethane glue tends to stain skin and is not easily cleaned off. <mark>Absorption through the skin may have carcinogenic concerns</mark></p>

    </div>
        <p>Bond strength is quite high. Since this glue is anhydrous, it is best kept capped when not in use. Store at room temperature. Excess air in the container tends to shorten the life of the product. Rumor has it that clean, dry, glass marbles added to the container to displace the air help to prolong the shelf life. I cannot substantiate this since I have not tried it, I lost my marbles years ago...:) just kidding! I CAN say: if the product seems quite thick after a lengthy shelf life, warming it with a heat gun or blow dryer makes it flow better and doesn't seem to affect the bond. Just don't over do it and avoid breathing the fumes!</p>
        <p>There are other brands of Polyurethane glues such as Gorilla glue (also a good product) I just happen to like the 3X since it foams less and is apparently stronger than other brands, I used the Elmers brand when building a kayak. The choice is yours.</p>
    
        <h3>Glue/Filler Mixing Containers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Don't throw away those measuring cups that come on liquid laundry detergent, rinse them out and they make great mixing containers for epoxies and wood fillers.</li>
            <li>Speaking of glue and fillers: I found I can make a pretty good wood filler from dry wood filler compounds like BIX stain putty and carpenters glue. In fact, even if your carpenters glue is starting to go off, it is still useful for making home made filler. I don't have an exact formula, I just estimate roughly how much filler I need and mix the dry filler into some glue until it thickens up nicely but is still spreadable. It takes a bit of stirring and you might need to add a few drops of water but I would suggest caution. Don't over do the water. It is sandable after a day or two but be careful not to use too much speed if you use a power sander such as a random orbit. If you get the filler too hot it tends to melt somewhat. Better to use the slowest speed possible. Take care you don't sand down the into the wood surface which would create depressions. Wood glue and sawdust or dry filler as mentioned will have a harder surface than most wood products once cured. Epoxy is even harder and is best filed rather than sanded, the idea is to flatten out the crown created by the epoxy. If you want to fill gaps with epoxy, acrylic micro-spheres are available. These are mixed with the epoxy and when cured can be filed and later touched up with sand paper.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Types of Lumber Cuts</h3>
        <p>There are 3 basic ways of sawing lumber: Flat, (typical construction lumber) Rift, and quarter sawn (typically used for furniture where movement is not desirable) The following lumber descriptions are quoted from <a href="http://www.advantagelumber.com/sawn-lumber/#plain-sawn">Advantage Lumber</a></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Plain Sawn</b> (aka Flat Sawn) wood is the most readily available type of wood to purchase. Milling this kind of material is faster as each log is sliced through the center. There is also very minimal waste involved. When you combine a larger yield of lumber with faster milling times, you also end up with a more affordable piece of lumber. Plain sawn wood material does have some structural drawbacks. Due to the tangential grain, there is a higher chance of cupping and twisting with plain sawn lumber.

                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li><b>Quarter Sawn</b> is more dimensionally stable than plain sawn lumber. More physical labor and time are required to make a piece of lumber, or flooring plank quarter sawn. By cutting a log into four quarters, then plain sawing each quarter, you end up with lumber that naturally resists cupping. This results in a material that has a more unique, linear grain pattern. Keep in mind, the increased labor and benefits bring a higher cost per board foot. Quarter sawing produces more waste than typical plain sawn lumber.

                </div>
            </li>
            <li><b>Rift Sawn</b> wood is used for applications that require straight lined grain through and through. For instance, tables, chairs and other furniture legs benefit greatly from having all exposed sides with the same linear appearance. Rift sawn lumber milling is more labor intensive than both plain and quarter sawn lumber. Which produces more waste per log. Rift sawn lumber is more expensive than quarter sawn wood due to the amount of labor involved in cutting each individual plank as well as the wasted wood.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As seen above, quarter and rift sawn lumber appears very much the same, however to some degree the end grain of quarter sawn lumber CAN sometimes appear at somewhat of an angle. It is generally accepted that Quarter sawn lumber has the least amount of movement and thus is not as succeptible to warping, twisting, cupping, end to end and lateral movement.
        Flat sawn lumber may show more interesting grain patterns but especially when plaining, tear-out often occurs. This can be minimised by the direction of feed through a plainer (or jointer) but it CAN still occur.</p>
