                <p>As a multi-media artist I enjoy carving, wood turning, painting, and mono-chromes which are either pencil or ink sketches. Each of us has talents God has given us, He has given me the ability to express myself through art. Many years passed before I actually considered myself an artist, but God has patiently used friends and family to help me realize I was burying the talent he gave me.</p>
                <p>Reflecting on the parable of the talents, I do not want to bury mine, rather I wish to use them for the enjoyment and inspiration of all.
                    As most kids do, I followed my father's pastime of creating art. While he painted and sketched, I drew pictures on my blackboard. Later this was followed by pen and pencil drawings, then by paintings on paper using cast-off materials given to me by my sister-in-law.</p>
                <p>For decades I sketched only when the mood struck me, otherwise there were gaps in my creativity. As years passed, friends and family encouraged me and I became more prolific but I still didn't think of myself as an artist. I simply considered what I did as self amusement. Mood no longer affected my ability to create art. The only restraint being available time as I am still working full time.</p>
                <p>I don't wish to "blow my own horn" here, what I did come to realize simply by looking at the work of other artists was that I too am an artist. I hope to inspire or encourage others having the urge to paint or draw to GO FOR IT! I often hear the comment 'I can't draw a straight line" to which I say: with some exception such as architecture, you seldom see straight lines in most art. Look at a landscape scene for instance, without man-made influence you will probably not see any "straight lines". Art lessons are usually available wherever you live but there is SO much information in any genra available on the Internet it is possible to be self taught and produce quality art. For instance: mixing colors, building canvases, mediums such as primers, acrylics, oils, brushes and so on... I started as many have before such tutorials but even I as I'm sure many do, refer to the Internet from time to time for tips and technical information. </p>
                <p>To loosely quote my favorite musician (Tommy Emmanuel) "life is what's happening now. This isn't a rehearsal so get after it!"</p>
                <p>I hope you enjoy my site. Please feel free to email me or leave a comment.</p>
                <p>God Bless, <br>Dave Browne</p>
                 <p> Over a number of years I have created or modified my sites to where they are now. I would like to thank Mike Townrow and Jonathan Rempel for their help and patience in helping me build better sites. DB</p>
