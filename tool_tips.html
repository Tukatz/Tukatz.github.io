            <p>This site is primarily intended to help the new woodworker but of course may also be useful to a seasoned one. The information I am including is largely directed at shop use rather than on-site or remote locations.</p>

            <h3 id="Jointer Setup">Jointer Setup</h3>
            <p>This applies to the King Industrial KC70FX 6" jointer. This jointer uses a cam system of bed adjustments whereas other jointers such as the General International use a different mechanism involving shims.</p>
            <p>After purchasing the KC70FX I had to make adjustments to the beds and fence to achieve proper alignment. Unfortunately the owners manual is <b>NOT</b>all inclusive with regards to set-up.The following information is not included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When fully raised, a straightedge placed across both in &amp; outfeed beds should make continuous contact.</li>
                <li>In the event either or both beds are not aligned as such, that is; if they are raised at either end or below level causing a gap between the benches and the straightedge, you must adjust them to insure your cut is not crowned. You must also check to ensure the beds are not twisted in relation to each other. I will point out the adjustments as I continue.</li>
                <li>In order to adjust either bed you must first remove the rabbeting extension plus the fence and fence bed in order to access 2 of the 8 Allen head set screws and eccentric bushings.
                    You will also have to remove the in-feed height indicator.</li>
                <li>You will need a 4mm Allen key to turn the set screws.</li>
                <li>First loosen the bed lock levers (part "A" fig's 23 &amp; 25 in the owners manual)</li>
                <li>Loosen the set-screws on both the in and outfeed beds, loosen the 2 lock-down levers and raise the beds. Place a straightedge across both beds. You may have to first adjust the "Min/Max" bed height limit screws as indicated in the manual.</li>
                <li>The straightedge should just <mark class="highlight"><i>touch</i></mark> the blades at "TDC" or top dead centre while also touching the entire length of the beds.</li>
                <li>If the straightedge does not make contact as described, you will have to adjust the eccentric bushings until it does. This may take a bit of tweaking and twiddling but the end result will be worth it! I found clamping the straightedge to the out-feed bed top is helpful so as to keep things consistent if you do not have an assistant.</li>
                <li>Once you have achieved proper alignment, tighten all 8 set-screws and the lock levers. Fence adjustment detentes are included in the owners manual. Once you have everything adjusted properly, your jointer should give you good performance.</li>
                <li>The arrows indicate set-screws &amp; eccentric bushings, <mark class="highlight">see photos.</mark></li>

            <h3 id="Band Saw Tune-ups">Band Saw Tune-ups</h3>
            <p>There are 2 basic wood band-saw styles on the market: bench or table-top &amp; floor mount, Naturally a table-top unit is <b>VERY</b> limiting in what you can cut with it in size, power and blade width.One design I would stay away from is a 3 wheel band-saw. They are notorious for throwing blades and are very hard to adjust. The dynamics of the 3rd (idler) wheel seem to be the main problem. Of course some folks will state they have no problem with a 3 wheeler just as there are folks who <i> for those of us old enough to remember</i> will tell you the same thing about 8 track tape players... no offence, just sayin' As with drill presses, the distance between the blade and post (throat) determines the size of the saw and what you can cut. Material thickness is determined by the distance between the table and the upper guides when they are fully raised. Some saws are single speed, some have 2 or more speeds for different material demands. some floor mount saws can accept a riser block that fits in the post allowing for thicker material to be cut. This of course means you need longer blades than normal to fit when a riser block is installed. Keeping your blade coiled for compact, safe storage takes a bit of know-how &amp; practice.</p>
            <p>The following link will help with that: <a href="https://food-health-365.com/video/faXLZkAdc8Q/Re-Coiling-a-Band-Saw-Blade/">How to Coil Bandsaw Blades</a></p>
            <ul>
                <li>After installing a new blade, a good idea is to soften the trailing edge of the blade (the edge furthest from the operator). This reduces the tendency to bind and chatter when cutting curves, thus creating a smoother cut. While the saw is running, use either a fine wet or oil stone or a fine flat file to remove the crisp trailing factory edge of the blade. Simply hold the file or stone against the trailing edges (<mark>use light pressure</mark>) and rotate the tool back and forth just enough to put a micro-round-over on the edges. <mark>Watch your fingers</mark>!</li>
                <li>Once that is done, you can take a hard stick of Carnauba wax or other non-silicone based wax and rub both sides of the blade while the saw is running. <mark>As always; watch your fingers</mark>! This will put a layer of wax on the blade which reduces friction when cutting. This is something you may want to do often if your bandsaw gets a lot of use. * A note here about Silicone based products: The use of Silocone based waxes &amp; lubricants on saw blades (table or bandsaw) as well as the tables or benches in the case of planers can cause "<i>fish eyes</i>" when applying clear (bright) finishes such as Varnishes, Polyurethanes, etc. Bees wax is acceptable for benches &amp; table tops if buffed after application however I don't suggest trying that with saw blades.</li>
                <li>Don't forget to release the tension on your bandsaw blades when the saw is not going to be used for a few days or more. That prevents flat spots on the tires.</li>
                <li>When changing blade sizes, make sure the blade fits properly between the guide blocks or bearings (which ever you have) <i>above & below the bandsaw table</i>. The trailing edge should be between the guides but NOT the teeth.</li>
                <li>The load bearings above &amp; below the table (behind the blade &amp; behind the guides) should be set so as to prevent the teeth from contacting the guides when the blade is under load. <mark>Failure to make these adjustments can cause the blade to break or at least cause damage to the teeth</mark>.</li>
                <li>Check your guides frequently as they can go out of adjustment when cutting tight curves. The spacing between the guides (above & below table) should not be more than the thickness of a match book cover.</li>
                <li>In the event you break a blade, providing the broken ends are not kinked, a good saw shop can probably weld the blade saving you the cost of a new one. I happen to have a bandsaw that uses blade lengths that are not available as factory made locally so my local shop custom makes my blades by welding bulk blade stock as needed.</li>
                <li>Note here in the attached photo, my blade guard is not aligned properly with the blade. The guard should be adjusted so the blade centers with the guard slot. However, as long as the blade is not touching the guard, this will not affect the cut as the working pressure pushes the blade away from the front of the guard. If however the blade touches the side of the guard it definitely needs adjustment.</li>
                <li>Make sure to keep the upper guides close to the work piece to avoid unnecessary stress on the blade!</li>
                <li>When cutting a straight line or re-sawing, a flat or straight fence tends to cause blade drift. That is; the blade wants to drift towards the fence.I prefer to steer the work piece allowing for a "proud" cut which can later be planed or sanded exactly to the reference line. There are fence add-ons available for some straight fences: These are convex pieces that attach to the business side of the straight fence. The idea here is to allow you to steer the work piece which keeps the blade relatively close and aligned to the reference line.</li>
                <li>If there is no convex attachment available for your saw you can cut one from a piece of hardwood or UMHW (the white stuff cutting boards are made of) With the use of the right clamp system this can be attached to your flat fence. You can even make your own custom re-saw fence using square aluminium tubing with a home made convex block attached. This can be clamped to your saw table using Speed clamps on either end of the fence.</li>
                <li>Don't force your saw, rather; let the blade do it's job without excessive force which tends to twist the blade and can cause the blade to break.</li>
                <li>Check your tires, bearings or guide blocks for wear &amp; sawdust buildup. Keeping these clean and in good shape helps accuracy and prolongs the life of the equipment.</li>
                <li>Adding a larger table (in &amp; out-feed) helps to support larger pieces of material.<mark>This does <b>not</b> increase the width of cut</mark>.</li>
            </ul>
            
            
            <h3 id="Table Saw Savvy">Table Saw Savvy</h3>
            <p>There are table saws and there are table saws...Which brand and which type you buy is up to you. However, not all table saws are created equal. There are table top contractor saws and floor mount contractor saws which are usually fairly light weight for portability. There are a variety of table sizes and types: plastic, stamped metal or even cast iron. Some can have wings added for cutting larger work pieces, some cannot.</p>
            <p>Then there are stationary or "shop saws" which usually have cast iron tops including "cabinet saws" which have cabinets that fully enclose the motor, trunion and arbor. These usually have more powerful motors than the former types.</p>
            <p>If you are looking for a saw for your home workshop, be it a single car garage or a purpose built detached shop, here are a few things to consider: With some exception, most portable (contractor) saws have very small, stamped steel, aluminum or cast aluminum tops at best. Even cheaper ones have plastic tables. These saws have their uses for rough cutting in construction but for the serious woodworker, pro or amateur these saws have undesirable qualities.</p>
            <p>The small size of the tables limit what you can safely and accurately cut. Ripping or cross-cutting a full sheet of plywood or other sheet goods is going to be out of the question. Why? 1st off; unless you secure these tiny saws they are going to want to slide around under the weight of say; a sheet of plywood. That can lead to kickback or worse such as having the saw fall off a temporary bench while running.</p>
            <p>Secondly; the table on these small saws wether cast aluminum,stamped metal or molded plastic are subject to warping, bending or even breaking. This is also a safety hazard and does nothing for accuracy.</p>
            <p>The fences that come with most of these saws (and I have yet to see otherwise) are less than accurate which is another safety problem. Having a stubby little fence that can warp or move an does little to guide your work piece lends it's self to kick-back which is very destructive and dangerous! I have personally witnessed a piece of wood go through the wall of a house from kick-back. I'm talking right through an exterior wall! That kind of force can cause serious or even fatal injury. I cannot understate the seriousness of kick-back!</p>
            <p>Thirdly: Unless a contractor saw is belt driven (some larger ones with cast iron tables are) they lack power. To compensate, the saw blade has to turn faster than a conventional belt driven saw, or to put it another way: faster than the motor driving the blade in order to rip lumber. To do that the arbor is gear driven in order to speed up the blade. Generally the motor runs at about 1700 RPM (in round numbers) whereas the blade needs to turn at about 4000 RPM or better. The gear boxes and gears in these saws (commonly and mistakenly called direct drive) are a real weak point. The gear box is usually plastic or "pot metal" being about 2 inches in diameter and at best only about 1/2 inch thick. The gears are usually either plastic orcast "pot metal", anything but sturdy!</p>
            <p>Years ago I found out the hard way it only takes one kick-back to destroy these gears and they are generally not replaceable! I blew up 2 of these table-top saws before I learned my lesson. So much for buying a cheap tool.</p>
            <p>The fences that come with these table top saws, (this goes for largely any table top or light weight contractor saw)are again, poorly built. You can see the deflection in these fences when you tighten them down. Why? 1st off they are flimsy, secondly they lock on the business end of the table (next to the operator) but they also hook over a bar or the opposite side of the saw. When you tighten a fence of this type, it twists under torque. It doesn't take much of a twist to cause a poor cut. When the fence twists, the lumber goes past the blade at a slight angle. This causes the blade to grab the lumber and "kick" it backwards toward the operator. The proof is a rough cut. A saw that cuts accurately (providing a good quality, clean, sharp blade is used) should give a fairly smooth, clean cut (more on this later).</p>
            <p>Why do I say all this about those small, portable or contractor saws? Simply this: Most people (regardless of gender) when doing wood working want to produce good quality results and don't want to spend extra money replacing tools thatjust don't perform or that break.</p>
            <p> As the saying goes: "a cheap man (or woman) pays twice! Buy good tools, (even if you have to buy 2nd hand) maintain them and use them wisely and they can last years if not a lifetime.</p>
            <p>This brings us around to shop saws. <mark>Note: horse power in electric tools these days doesn't mean squat! The ratings are very mis-leading or simply don't tell you anything. Electric horsepower is determined by a formula involving Amperage and RPM. IE: for a 1 HP motor running on 110 to 120V at 60Hz single phase AC; at 3450 RPM the rating should be 13 to 15 Amps. At 1725 RPM the rating should be 13.6 Amps to 16 Amps. Some tools use Watts as a power rating, that tells you nothing! There are reference books such as the "Pocket Ref" by Thomas J. Glover or the information can be found on-line where you can find the true horse power of any electric motor regardless of voltage, single or 3 phase.</mark></p>
            <p>There are a multitude of shop table saws on the market. These will generally have cast iron tables, some are capable of accepting table extensions or wings. The bigger the table top (within reason) the bigger the sheet goods you can handle with ease and safety! Yes there are differences in the quality of the cast iron from brand to brand but unless money is not an issue and you want a tool that can be passed through several generations, this is not a major issue.</p>
            <p>Here are some things I suggest looking for in a shop or stationary table saw: I prefer a solid cast table for this reason; with a honeycomb table there is some possibility or even probability you will eventually catch your fingers in one of the holes while manoeuvering a piece of lumber... <b>OUCH</b> (I've done it) Yes, a solid table top adds weight but if the saw is not being moved around (which isn't great for it anyhow) weight simply adds stability!</p>
            <p>I would lookfor a saw that has no less than a 1 HP motor. Better yet 1 1/2 to 2 HP. Power is good! I also would look for a saw with either a 220V or a dual voltage motor, (one that can run on either 110V or 220V) The results of using a 220V motor are: quicker start-up, less heat, less tendency to power out and less draw on start-up. <mark>A 110V motor under load can have a start-up draw of around 80 Amps for the 1st few seconds until it reaches full RPM.</mark> That leads to excessive wear, heat, load on your electrical system, and power consumption! Heat is bad for motors and overloading your breaker will eventually cause it to fail, not to mention the possibility of causing a fire!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you have a motor that draws for example; 12 amps on 110V, on 220V the same motor would draw 6 amps. Note that with a dual voltage motor you cannot use both voltages simultaneously. You must wire the motor for one or the other voltage!A dual voltage motor will have a box on the motor in which the leads can be switched so as to change what voltage it runs on. This should be done by an electrician or at least someone who has experience with electric motors. If you change from 110V operation to 220V, aside from the connections in the box the only other thing you need to do is select the proper 220V male plug (determined by the Amperage draw of the motor) The plug will have an indicated rating. (they are NOT all the same!) Of course you also need a 220 V wall plug or extension cord if necessary that is rated for the same draw.(plus a 220V breaker) If per chance you do not have access to 220 V power in your shop and have to convert the saw motor to 110V you might have to use heavier gauge wire such as 12 or even 10 gauge if a long cord is necessary. Leaning on the heavier side for 110V applications doesn't hurt simply because of the heavier amp draw. Too light a gauge wire on 110V causes heat, a by-product of resistance.</li>
            </ul>
            
            
            <h3 id="Vibration and Blade Hop">Vibration and Blade Hop</h3>
            <p>One of the common reasons for vibration in a table saw is the type of belt used to turn the blade. In times past it was normal for saws to be equipped with "V" or fractional horsepower belts. When these belts are forced to go around small pulleys, they tend to bunch up slightly causing "hop". A better choice is a notched belt, segmented or even a serpentine belt if the saw is equipped with the right pulley type for the latter. These belts rotate smoothly around small pulleys. Of course vibration can have other sources but the belt is the most common. I will deal with other causes later in this article.</p>
            
            
            <h3 id="Tuning Up">Tuning Up</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Saw blade set-up is an essential part of owning and using any table saw. <b>Never assume that the factory has perfectly tuned or set up your saw before you purchase it</b>! For shop or stationery saws you must loosen the bolts holding the trunion to which the saw arbor is attached and swivel the trunion until proper allignment is achieved. The rest of the process is largely the same for all saws as follows: The mitre slot in the saw table is your reference point. You can go really high-tech and use a dial gauge attached to a bar riding in one of the mitre slots or you can simply use a good quality steel rule. You could also create a simple "feeler" gauge by using either a wood, plastic or metal glide bar and base with an adjustable stiff wire "feeler". Place the tool in one of the mitre slots and set the feeler to <i>just touch</i> the saw blade "gullet" between two of the teeth next to the operator. Slide the tool forward to just touch a gullet on the far side of the blade. (It doesn't matter which side you do 1st, closest to the operator or the opposite end) As you rotate the blade it should make continuous contact with the feeler in both positions. If not or if one position seems tighter than the other, it is likely your trunion is out of adjustment. With shop saws this is when you have to swivel the trunion until the measurement or position is equal front and back. Once you have established the correct allignment, tighten the trunion bolts and re-check to make sure nothing has moved in the process.</li>
                <li>To check for a warped blade,the process is similar; simply set the tool feeler gauge until it <i>just touches</i> the blade below the teeth either on the operator end or the far end of the blade. Rotate the blade by hand, if the blade is warped it should touch the feeler guage in some spots and not in others.</li>
                <li>A warped blade is useless, toss it!</li>
                <li>There are 2 basic types of saw fences for both table and band saws. The old style of which there are some variations have a locking handle or knob next to the operator, and either a hook, lever, or knob on the far end. As mentioned earlier, it is nearly impossible (from experience) to get these fences to align perfectly to the mitre slot. The reason being torque. I can't explain the physics of the problem entirely, but basically what happens is: as the old style fences are "locked down" it causes the fence to twist slightly so that the fence is not exactly parallel to the mitre slot. No amount of tinkering will produce an exact alignment. The other style of saw fence is known as a "T" fence which has the lock-down lever on the operator end. The far end floats and usually has an adjustable support that rides on the saw rail on the out-feed end of the table. On the operator end the fence will have adjustment screws that give lateral adjustment allowing the fence to be perfectly aligned with the mitre slot front to back. Some "T" fences also have screws that provide virtical adjustment so that the fence sides can sit perfectly at 90 degrees to the table. To sum up: <mark>both the fence and the blade need to be aligned to the mitre slot. <b>NOT</b> to each other!</mark> It is incorrect to align the saw blade to the fence! <mark>The mitre slot <b>IS</b> your reference point</mark>. Both the blade and the fence should be aligned to the slot. If you were to align the saw blade to the fence without 1st aligning them both to the mitre slot you could and probably would cause "Parallellism" meaning that even if the blade and fence are equally spaced front and back, they may be still out of alignment with the mitre slot. This causes a very rough cut and also allows the wood to climb on the blade which can and very likely will cause kick-back! (again, this is taken from personal experience!). Kick-back is not to be taken lightly! I once had a small piece of wood kick back from a saw, it grazed my side through my shirt causing a bruise and nasty abrasion. The piece of wood deflected off my side and nearly went through a metal clad door! </li>
                <li>If you are cutting very thin material such as veneer, you may want to add an auxiliary fence. If you have a "T" style fence (which should not rest directly on the saw table) you can add a piece of material such as "UMHW" often referred to as Teflon, or a piece of Plexi-glass, Lexan, or sheet Acrylic. It should have a good straight factory edge next to the table. If your T fence has "T" slots or tracks in the sides, you can use "T" bolts to secure the auxiliary fence to the main fence. If your saw fence does not have "T" tracks in the sides you can counter-sink screws through the add-on fence and secure it to the original fence. You can clamp it on if the clamps do not interfere with the work piece and if the add-on fence does not warp. I use a piece of hardwood flooring with the factory finish facing the blade when I am rabbeting lumber. The add-on fence in this case has a semi-circle of material cut away from the bottom side which allows the dado set clearance to do it's job without contacting either the original or the add-on fence. Some woodworkers choose to build a cap fence that covers the entire "T" fence. The idea with any of these add-on fences for cutting thin material is to eliminate the gap between the fence and saw deck or table. This keeps the thin material from pinching or sliding under the original fence which would otherwise cause a cutting error or an accident. <mark>Remember to allow the extra thickness of an add-on fence when setting up your cut</mark>!</li>
                <li>If you work with sheet goods (plywood or veneer, etc) and have the space for an out-feed table built around your saw, it is a great add-on which will make handling large pieces much easier, safer and more secure than accessory or out-feed rollers or stand alone supports. Just remember to leave enough gap at the far end of the saw table to allow for fence movement.</li>
                <li>I find that rollers can pull material away from or towards the saw blade, a most likely result of the floor being out of level. This is not to say that rollers are bad, sometimes there are no other options.</li>
                <li>Keep your cast iron top clean &amp; free of glue or other deposits and <b>never put anything wet in contact with cast iron surfaces</b></li>
                <li>A good idea is to use one of the available (NON Silicone based) spray-on treatments or a non silicone wax that can be buffed after application. This helps to prevent rust and provides reduced friction when sliding lumber across the table. <mark>A silicone based product can cause Fish-eyes under clear finishes</mark>.</li>
                <li>When ripping lumber it is best when cutting narrow strips to cut to the outside of the blade as opposed to between the fence &amp; blade. It does not matter whether your saw is right or left tilt. Even with a well tuned saw, small strips cut between the blade &amp; fence can bind and fly back at you plus you don't want to cut into your push stick.</li>
                <li>When cutting bevels you do <b>NOT</b> want your blade to tilt toward the fence! This is a recipe for disaster! Not only will the material being cut jamb or bind between the blade and fence causing kick-back, but there is potential for damage to the fence, blade, arbor and bearings!</li>
                <li>Your saw will come with a table insert that fits around your blade. Most wood workers including myself prefer to make extra inserts. Zero clearance inserts for single blades and custom ones for dado blades. The latter will need to have angled openings to allow for tilt. I use leftover plywood that is the right thickness so they sit flush with the table top. If the insert is slightly loose you can add a spot of hot glue to the edge (see photo) to take up the slack. If you happen to use sheet acrylic you could drill & tap the insert on 4 corners for adjustment screws. This would allow you to make fine adjustments to the height of the insert. Some factory inserts are equipped with these screws. You don't want the insert to sit higher or lower than the table top.</li>
                <li>In the photos below: note the adjusting screws in the fence. Originally my fence had a magnifier on the space indicator, however it took a hit and broke off. For now I scribed a line on the stub and hi-lited it with a marker. The white add-on fence is acrylic. I drilled it and used small carriage bolts that I ground flat on 2 sides of the heads to slide into the "T" slot. I use wing nuts to secure it. The black end cap on the fence pops out to slide the bolt heads in. For the rabbet add-on fence I use speed clamps to secure it but "C" clamps would do as well.</li>

            <h3 id="Router Tips">Router Tips</h3>
            <p>As with many woodworkers, I have a duplicity in certain tools largely for convenience. For instance: I have several routers; two 1/2", a 1/4" and a 4 Amp Dremel with a router attachment. Most often I use an old Makita 1/2" plunge router that I use as a shaper. It is mounted permanently in a custom cabinet on an aluminum adaptor plate and has the springs removed since they are of no use in an upside down position. The plate (marketed by Samona) is 1/4" thick and has leveling screws in each corner. Under each screw I placed a shortened 3" nail in a pre-drilled hole in the table top which is cut out and rabbeted to accept the mounting plate. The nail heads provide a hard contact point for the adjusting screws. The adaptor plate (which is a universal plate) has had the router hanging from it for nearly 20 years and has not sagged or warped. Previous to this I had an even thicker Phenolic adaptor plate which after only 6 months sagged with only a light 1/4" router hanging from it. I strongly suggest an aluminum plate for anyone wanting to build a router table or cabinet. The Samona plate also has holes for mounting guide pins (supplied with the plate) It also has 2 pop-out zero-clearance center pieces that allow for different diameter bits.</p>
            <p>My cabinet is mounted on steerable wheels and is about 39" high or waist height for me. These days table height for shop equipment is recommended to be about waist height for the operator for comfortable use. Obviously this will vary from person to person. *My cabinet has 3 compartments, the center one under the router has a removable, sloped deck jus under the router to aid dust collection at the rear of the cabinet. I use a 4"x10" "Y" dust port that slides into place on the opening at the back of the cabinet when I need it. Under the center sloped deck there is storage for equipment. The other 2 compartments have roll-out trays for router bits, other tools and accessories.</p>
            <p>The cabinet top is 1" thick MDF (medium density fibreboard) which is laminated top and bottom with plastic laminate to reduce friction and also to prevent sagging in the event there is ever high humidity. This was recommended by the cabinet shop that built the top for me. The top is 25"x49" and has 1" hardwood edges to facilitate clamping. I also dadoed the top to mount a "T" track for push tools.</p>
            <p>I built an adjustable, laminated fence (also from MDF) which allows for different size bits. I chose MDF as it does not warp where as plywood is succeptable to warping with changes in humidity. *On one end of my cabinet I added a 4 plex electrical box with one switched plug-in for the router. I leave the factory router switch on all the time and operate it with the auxiliary switch. This is much easier and I would suggest safer as well as eliminating wera &amp; tear on the factory switch. The other outlets just provide power for other tools. My cabinet looks a bit tacky from years of hard use but then, its not living room furniture...</p>
            <p>Occasionally I use a hand held router such as when I'm cutting out circulat patterns or working with pieces too large for my table. Incidentally, I built my router cabinet fairly large in order to support longer or larger work pieces. My 1st table was a typical small, open table as usually sold by tool stores or "Big box" hardware &amp; building supply stores. These are mostly promoted to the home owner, DIY folks. As with "Contractor" or table top saws, {perhaps I'm a bit biased here <b>:)</b> }I find these little router tables too flimsey, too light, unstable and they provide very little support for larger or longer work pieces. They are generally not suited for larger routers and I find them mostly a pain in the neck!</p>
            <p>Another note about routers: While small routers (1/4" or even 3/8" which refers to collet size) do have their uses, I would suggest buying a good 1/2" router. They have more power and can turn larger bits easier and safer. 1/4" shank bits are more susceptable to vibration or even bending in extreme cases. I personally wouldn't bother to buy a fixed base router. why not have the capability of a plunge router rather than limiting yourself? If you did want to mount your router in a table top you could always remove the springs to make adjusting easier. Also: 1/2" routers come with collet adaptors for use with 1/4" or even 3/8" shank bits.</p>
            <p><mark>When inserting a bit into the collet, don't bottom out the shank since that can damage the collet and also make extracting the bit difficult later.</p>
            <p>It is good practice to clean your router motor windings, collet, and plunge towers once in a while. Sawdust and resins can build up in these places and cause binding, sticking or worse.</mark> I use compressed air to clean the motor. To clean the collet I find Methyl Hydrate (Methyl or Wood Alcohol) works fine since it is made from wood byproducts in the 1st place. Another product that works well is "NAPA" water-based industrial cleaner/degreaser #70004. It is ecologically safe and after only seconds will dissolve resins on router bits, collets, and saw blades as well. I just use a soft copper brush or a non-metallic kitchen scrubber to assist the cleaner. After cleaning I use a quick squirt of WD40 on the plunge towers, springs and collet. It tends to dry out after a while but initially provides a little lubrication rather than a totally dry mechanism and it doesn't collect dust like a thicker oil product would.</p>
            <p><mark>Resin buildup on any high speed cutting tool or bearing causes binding and burning which can ruin the tool. It also produces less than clean cuts.</mark></p>
            <p>To clean router bit bearings I remove them, let them soak in Methyl Hydrate, blow the residue out with compressed air and lube the bearings in this case with a drop of mineral oil (4 in 1) or sewing machine oil. These oils are very thin and have low viscosity.</p>
            <p><mark>When it comes to tool cost, remember as stated earlier; " the cheap guy pays twice"! Cheap tools don't usually give quality results and have to be replaced often. A lazy guy pays twice since his tools don't fair well with lack of maintenance! A good tool properly maintained can last many years! Buy the best you can afford.</mark> 
            <li>My 1st router was a poor choice, it was a fixed base unit and I discovered after using it a few times the bearings were pretty bad. It seemed to run smooth at first, then it made some high frequency buzzing noises that clued me in I had been sold a lemon. As for router bits, if you want good results, buy good bits! I suggest Freud, they have superior quality carbides and friction reducing coating. There are other good bits on the market but you can't go wrong with Freud, they have a lifetime warranty! I have seen off-shore carbides fail easily but I have never seen a Freud bit fail! I once dropped an expensive Freud bit on a concrete floor, the carbide survived without a mark, but the floor was chipped! The choice is yours, I want to state again; I am not trying to sell any particular brand and do not get any remuneration from any company or vendor.</li>
            Router images: note the 4 leveling screws in the plate corners plus the guide pin holes in the red insert. Again, I use speed clamps to hold the fence when it is in position. Carriage bolts with wing nuts to lock the fence wings.</p>

            <h3 id="Plane knives and Chisels">Plane knives and Chisels</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It goes without saying: the better the quality of the tool, the better the quality of the job, the easier it is to use, the longer it will last, and it will hold an edge longer, etc.</li>
                <li>Years ago plane knives and chisels were made of laminated steel, having a core of metal different than the outside. These usually held an edge better than blades of single metal and generally had a longer working life! These days you will be hard pressed to find that quality. If you are looking for chisels &amp; hand planes, older second hand ones can be of good value. Occasionally you will find these at estate sales, retirement sales, the odd yard sale or auctions. Normally you can tell a laminated blade by looking at the edges. There will be a slight color difference in the layers. This is something I learned some years ago from a retired english cabinet maker. He not only showed me the difference but also told me that even a chisel or plane (knife &amp; body) that had been sharpened many times could still have a lot of value as long as there was enough metal to still be sharpened. Also the plane bodies can be re-surfaced or milled to make them true again. This is something I have tried and it does work! I use a selection of wet/dry sandpaper to do this as I do not have a milling machine to do the work. I simply wet the sand paper and lay it on a piece of plate glass. Work the sole of the plane in a circular motion taking care to keep the tool flat and the sides at 90 deg. to the plate glass. When changing to a finer grit of paper, rinse the glass 1st. If the sole does not need a major tune-up, you can probably start with perhaps a 400g or finer paper. It is time consuming and takes some elbow grease but worth it. A well maintained tool will always do a better/safer job than a dull, worn tool.</li>
                <li><mark>A note: More accidents in woodworking happen as a result of dull tools than sharp ones since one has to use more force to make the cuts and dull tools often slip. Not to mention the end results are less than perfect.</mark></li>
                <li>It's a good idea to check your plane soles occasionally if you use them a lot, the same goes for 2nd hand ones. One method isto apply some machinists bluing to the sole of the plane and make a couple of passes over the wet/dry sandpaper. If the sole needs surfacing it will show as portions of the sole will be free of bluing. The areas that retain it are hollows. Black marker will do in a pinch if you can't get your hands on bluing. After honing or stropping, don't forget to apply a non-silicone treatment like WD40 to prevent rust. Simply spray on & wipe with a soft cotton rag.</li>
                <li>Always store or dispose of rags exposed to solvents & oils in a safe fashion, as spontaneous combustion may otherwise result. One method is to simply soak the rags in water and place then (preferrably) outdoors to dry. You can also store them in a metal container with a lid.</li>
                <li>Sharpening both plane knives and chisels requires a low speed bench grinder (1725rpm) if they are in bad condition having nicks or a very dull edge. Better yet is a wet bench grinder. There are several brands on the market that usually have a wider stone than a conventional grinder. They have a water trough that the stone runs in and generally turn at perhaps 100 RPM or less. Another good feature of these wet grinders is: they are reversable. As with hand carving tools, I find having the stone turn away from you also works well for regular chisels and plane knives. I do not recommend using a conventional bench grinder of about 3400 RPM as it will burn the edge of your tools which takes the temper out of the metal causing it to dull quickly There is also a Veritas sharpening system for use with low speed bench grinders. See: http://www.leevalley.com I am sure there are other brands of sharpening jigs, this is just a suggestion.</li>
                <li>Once you have done your basic sharpening on the grinder, you should then hone the cutting tool with either good quality wet stones, diamond hones, or oil stones. I use a Japanese double sided wet stone, I have lost the original box but I believe it is 1000 Grit on one side and 4000 G to the reverse. The stone works well in combination with the Veritas honing jig from Lee Valley Tools and I have read that water stones cut faster than oil stones. However, these stones require frequent dressing in the same manner as dressing the sole of a hand plane. <mark>As you hone your cutting tools the surface of the stone will eventually start to cup. This must be dressed perfectly flat frequently to avoid rounding of your cutting tool edges!</mark> It is a good idea to rinse the slurry often to avoid buildup of fine metal particles. Definitely change the water in the stone bath often and thoroughly rinse it before changing to finer grits!</li>
                <li>Always pre-soak water stones before using them and use a water-tight tray filled just above the stone when honing. Try to use the entire stone surface to reduce cupping.</li>
                <li>Always rinse all sharpening equipment after use and allow the stones to dry to avoid damage to your stones.</li>
                <li>Sharpening your tools on a bench grinder as described above produces what is called a "wire edge". This is normal. If the stone turns toward you it is possible to create a rounded over edge which defeats the whole purpose of sharpening. When you hone your cutting tools you want to draw the tool towards yourself to remove this wire edge. Care must be taken to keep the cutting tool edge perfectly parallel tothe stone to avoid uneven honing. This is where honing jigs and grinder jigs come in handy as it is very difficult to get a consistant and accurate edge otherwise. I like the Veritas system also because you can set the honing jig to create a Micro bevel which improves the cut and makes it easier.</li>
                <li>When your cutting tools have acquired an edge that does not produce a bright line under a lamp, you are ready for stropping.</li>
                <li>Once you have finished with the finest of your honing stones you may want to "strop" your tool using a leather strop and some jewelers rouge. I use an old, wide genuine leather belt stretched tight on a flat surface with clamps but you can buy purpose built strops if you prefer. The method is to rub some rouge on the strop and polish the tool the same way you hone it, drawing it towards yourself. A good strop job will produce a mirror finish!</li>
                <li>I have experimented with a cylinder of Mahogany turned on my lathe as a power strop for chisels and carving tools. I don't necessarily recommend this for the novice, better to learn the basics 1st. However, what I did was to rub jewelers rouge on the cylinder as it turned. (make sure to use the slowest speed possible, I would recommend no more than 500RPM, slower if possible. If you have a lathe with reverse the job is made much easier since you want the strop to turn away from the cutting edge. This requires a steady drawing action rather than pushing! At any stage of sharpening, the angle of the tool edge to the sharpening surface is critical in order to prevent rounding over and also to get the proper cutting angle. Hand carving tools need special sharpening since the bevel angles are much lower than typical carpenters chisels. Also, they are honed on the top side rather than the bottom. For carving tools there are "feather stones" for dressing the top side of the cutting edge to remove the wire edge. <mark>The angles for plane knives and chisels are as follows:</mark>
                    <ul>
                        <li><mark> Bevel angles 15-20 Deg; paring chisels, skew chisels, low-angle planes for softwood, and skew-blade planes.</mark></li>
                        <li> <mark>20-25 Deg; all of the above except skews for hardwood or end grain.</mark></li>
                        <li> <mark>25-30 Deg. Paring &amp; light mortising chisels, firmer chisels for softwood, most plane knives & spoke shave blades.</mark></li>
                        <li> <mark>30-35 Deg. Mortising chisels &amp; firmer chisels for hardwood, Plane knives for hardwood with pin knots.</mark></li>
                        <li> <mark>35-40 Deg. Heavy use mortising chisels and brittle steel.</mark></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If you are using a honing guide such as the Veritas model you can dial-in a micro-bevel which reduces the need to hone the entire cutting surface as the actual cutting is done at the leading edge. The Micro-bevel need only be about 1/16". As follows, here are some Bevel angles followed by micro-bevels:
                    <ul>
                        <li><mark>15 Deg. > 16-17 Deg.</mark></li>
                        <li><mark> 20 Deg. > 21-22 Deg.</mark></li>
                <li> <mark>25 Deg. > 26-27 Deg.</mark></li>
                        <li> <mark>30 Deg. > 31 1/4 - 32 1/2 Deg.</mark></li>
                        <li><mark> 35 Deg. > 36 1/2 Deg.- 38 Deg.</mark></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Note that wood turning tools do not need honing to the same extent but it is critical that they be sharp! Some wood turners including myself prefer to round off the crisp edges of gouges to prevent digging in, tearing or splitting work pieces. (see photo in "Lathes") A turning tool that is dull or that catches in turning wood can cause serious injury! More on that under the Lathe heading.</li>
            </ul>
            
            
            <h3 id="Disc, Hand, & Belt Sanders">Disc, Hand, &amp; Belt Sanders</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I don't have a lot to say about disc sanders so far. I have a 12" bench mount disc sander that does get a fair bit of use. I also have one of those tiny combination belt/disc sanders for which i have no use for the disc and little use for the belt these days. I use self adhesive discs on the big disc and find the easiest way to remove worn discs is to heat the disc with a heat gun which softens the adhesive and leaves almost no residue. As with all my dust producing equipment, this sander has a dust extraction port. It came with a bag but I prefer to connect it to my dust collector in order to keep dust to a minimum in my shop. I find sander bags for any type power sander tend to clog up quickly leaving too much dust in the air and also collecting on the sanding surface which turns into hard, resin lumps that end up marring the wood surface.</li>
                <li>As for power hand sanders, I don't have a lot to say other than the fact I like to use a random-orbit sander that uses "Hook &amp; Loop" pads (Velcro). It works well and doesn't create the swirl marks left by flat sheet sanders. The reason as far as I can see is that the dust is extracted through the holes in the discs (via a dust collector) rather than building up as deposits on the sanding surface. Yes there are times buildup occurs depending on what you are sanding even with a random orbit sander. Then the only solution is to either use a crepe eraser which you can find at tool stores that cater to wood workers, (I use one on all my power sanders) or if the deposits won't come off the disc or belt, then replacement is a must.</li>
                <li>About the only thing I use a 1/4 sheet palm sander for is when I want to drive in an oil finish such as a Watco product. For that I use a very fine wet-dry paper.</li>
                <li><mark>A caution here from a lesson learned the hard way: Be careful not to sand anything that has wet C/A (Cyanoacrylate) on it. It eats the rubber backing on your sander!</mark></li>
                <li>I am not a big fan of portable belt sanders, they do have their uses but due to the speed at which they operate they can quickly eat away too much material or can also gouge the work surface. I do however have an ancient but still functional 24" floor mount belt sander that can operate virtically or horizontally. That unit gets a lot of use in my shop. Another sander I have is a 3/8" air driven belt sander. The belt angle is variable since the belt sticks out in front of the drive motor. So far the only thing I have used it for was sanding chess pieces, specifically the knights. This sander does require a lot of air for continuous use, something like 15 CFM.</li>
                <li>If I have to smooth an edge joined slab, I start with my thickness planer as long as the slab is no more than 12" wide. I then finish up with the random-orbit sander. One tool I do wish I owned is a thickness sander, similar to a thickness planer. However I do not have the space for one. The name "Thickness sander" is somewhat misleading as you cannot take off nearly as much material in one pass as a thickness planer. It is more of a surfacing machine not capable of taking off much more than a few thousands of an inch per pass. A thickness plainer can take off perhaps 1/32' give or take depending on the type of wood.</li>
                <li>If you are building a wood slab larger than your thickness planer can handle, often a local cabinet shop will run the slab through their large capacity pneumatic sander for a small fee. They might even do it for free if you are in "tight" with the owner.</li>
                <li>A note on dust ports: Since the dust ports on palm, belt, R/O and disc sanders are quite small, you will have to use an adaptor to hook up to any sort of dust extraction equipment. Over time I have had a number of these adaptors crack and they are difficult to keep attached since they are usually friction fit. My R/O sander came with a dust port adaptor that goes from oval on the tool end to round on the hose end. It is supposed to connect to shop-vac hoses of different sizes. I found I had to buy a 2nd adaptor to go between the hose and the factory adaptor. The problem is not only do these hard plastic adaptors eventually break or crack, they constantly come apart from vibration and the weight of the hose attached. I finally got fed up with this and glued the 2 adaptors together with some "Weld-on" # 16 solvent cement which is used for acrylics. Now all I do is attach the 2 1/4" shop vac hose to the outer adaptor then attach a 2 1/4" to 4" adaptor that fits my dust collector intake. It takes care of all the dust even though the suction is reduced by the small hose. (more on this subject in "Dust collection").</li>
            </ul>
            
            
            <h3 id="Mitre Saws">Mitre Saws</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I find the factory mitre saw fences are a bit clumsy mostly because they are too short, but I have also discovered they may not be accurate as in the case of my bench-mounted saw. It was slightly warped from the factory and could not be fixed. True, I cannot say this is always the case but it goes without saying that a fence that is not accurate is largely useless. I noticed that my mitres were not coming out tight, and that there was always a slight error. after checking with a straight edge and machinists square the original fence formed a barely noticable "V" shape that could not be fixed. I realize it would likely be a shipping problem for the factories to supply longer fences and would increase the cost of the tool and portability would be somewhat difficult for the contractor but accuracy is the whole reason for a mitre saw.</li>
                <li>Here's a handy DIY mitre fence you can easily build that done with care will give you much better results. I made mine from an 8 ft. length of 1/8" x 2" aluminum angle. First cut it in half, (your carbide mitre blade will easily cut 1/8" aluminum with no damage or you can use a "zip" disc on an angle grinder), then depending on wether your saw is single or double compound you will need to cut the end/s of the fence next to the blade at 45 to 48 Deg. as well as in full tilt position. You may want to take a flat file and clean up the cuts later if there are any burrs. The bevel will usually exceed 45 Deg. on most mitre saws. Angling the ends can be done after the fence is secured to the saw deck. Before mounting your new fence, remove the factory fence and use them as templates to mark the bolt holes on the new fence pieces. Drill the holes in the new fence slightly larger than the originals so as to have some adjustment. Carefully mark &amp; center-punch where the new holes will be and preferrably use a drill press to drill the mounting holes. Once the fence segments are installed, use a straight-edge to align them and also use a square (preferrably a machinists square) to check that they are at 90 Deg. to the blade when the saw is set at "0" Deg. <b>Unlike the mitre slot in your table saw, the slot in the mitre saw deck is not your reference.</b> When checking for 90 Deg. alignment, place a small machinists square against the fence segments and against the blade but not touching the carbide teeth since that can throw your adjustment out. Place the square blade between the saw teeth (in the gullet). Check both right and left fence segments, tighten the fence bolts and re-check in case there has been any movement during the process!</li>
                <li>Adding a self adhesive measuring tape to both L &amp; R fences is a great help when you are making precise cuts. A stop block is essential when making repeat cuts of the same length such as in picture frames. You could go fancy and use a block of aluminum custom cut so it slides freely across the fence without slop, it would have to be drilled and tapped for a set-screw on the reverse side. This would probably best be done by a machine shop or Fab' shop. Alternatively you could use a perfectly square block of hardwood drilled and counter-bored to accept a nut. This would have to be a snug fit so the nut needed to be tapped into place with a hammer, but 1st set in epoxy. Care must be taken to keep epoxy out of the threads, one way is to thread a bolt (cap screw if you prefer) into the nut before driving the nut into the hole. Remove the bolt after installation and let the epoxy harden for at least an hour or longer depending on the epoxy used. I used the latter method and it works well for me and the cost was negligible.</li>
                <li>Having support for long pieces of wood is pretty much essential, (another reason for a longer fence!) You can also build a simple table matched to the height of the mitre-saw deck, that can be placed on either side of the saw. My saw sits on a long, narrow Oak bench so my material support sits under the fence rather than on the floor. Remember; these tips are largely for shop-used tools rather than remote work sites.</li>
                <li>How you choose to collect the sawdust from your mitre saw is up to you. Some folks prefer a "Y" port or some sort of box affair that sits behind the saw, this being connected to your dust collection system. In my case I do not have the space for one so I use an adaptor that reduces from 4" to the port size on the saw to connect directly to my dust collector system. It is not a perfect solution as some dust escapes due to reduced air flow but it was the only solution I could use given limitations in my shop.</li>
                <li>As for what brand of mitre saw to buy, I do not intend to "sell" any particular tool brands on this site. Any mention of tool brands on this site are incidental. I <b>may</b> make a suggestion here &amp; there as to why I like a certain tool such as the Bosch 10" sliding mitre saw even though I don't own one but that is just my opinion. For instance: The Bosch mitre saw has a number of very good features such as a belt drive which in the event of a kick-back or binding can slip or at worst break. Compared to conventional drive mitre saws which in the event of kick-back or binding can end up with bent arbors or a broken fence among other things. Those go to the scrap yard! Another really excellent feature of the Bosch is a device that allows adjustment at any detent by a couple of degrees left or right without slipping. This is handy if you need a cut that is slightly off a set angle such as 45 Deg. for example.</li>

            <h3 id="Dust Collection">Dust Collection</h3>
            <p>This is one of my pet peeves. There are many opinions on dust collection, some good, some not so good. What follows is what I've learned from experience and what works for me. In brief: I don't use a shop vac for dust collection directly from any tool. In the early days I did and was continually cleaning out the filter even though the vac can was nowhere near full. After a few minutes of operation the filter would get so clogged with fine dust so that the shop vac hardly had any suction. The 1st problem is small filter size/small surface area. The 2nd problem is that vacuum cleaners work on velocity but are limited to capacity. They are fine for cleaning up the floor of coarse material but are not built to handle continuous flow of fine material. The alternative is a purpose built dust collector which has a turbine style fan built of heavy steel which can handle any size material including knots without damage or clogging. They also have one or more bags that act as filters and collectors. Some of the new generation collectors use a round accordian style filter rather than a bag. These have a rod that can be rotated inside the filter to knock off fine dust. Also, plastic bags are available for the bottom to contain the sawdust. I still use my heavy canvas bottom bag as it can breathe somewhat which increases air flow. I also still use a canvas upper bag as a filter. (old school but it works) What makes dust collectors more effecient than vacuums aside from what I have already mentioned is that they work on volume rather than velocity.</p>
            <p>There is a lot more to be said about dust collection: My 1st collector was a small one having only 1 bag that had to serve as both collection and filtration. The blower was small producing something like 560 CFM (cubic feet per minute) air flow. The horse power rating was supposedly 3/4HP which as I mentioned in the table saw article is rather mis-leading. At 1725 RPM on 110V @ 5.7Amps, this actually translates to 1/3 HP! Even hooked to a table saw, this collector was not really up to the job. Later I bought a dust collector that produces 1200CFM (which is probably right at the blower intake) This collector has 2 bags: the top one is the filter, the bottom one is the collector. I have the unit plumbed in to several different areas of my shop via 4" PVC pipe. Each pipe connects to a common manifold and each has a cap on the inlet to prevent loss of suction when not in use. I only use one port at a time for that reason not to mention I can only run one machine at a time anyhow.</p>
            <p>You could use blast gates for the same purpose but I find the caps are quite effective, cheap and trouble free. I have had plastic blast gates break or get sawdust stuck in the gate preventing them from closing.</p>
            <p>My shop is not big being only about 400 S/F and while my collector is adequate for most tools, I would be better off with a larger one of about 2000CFM. My lathe and mitre saw are rather difficult to collect from, the saw having a very small dust port, and the lathe has none and would be very difficult to construct an efficient port for.</p>
            <p>Grounding is essential if you use PVC or any plastic pipe for dust collection.<mark>Dry sawdust creates a <b>lot</b> of static electricity as it passes through the pipe! This is dangerous not only for shock hazard but can also cause an explosion! <b><u>I cannot stress this enough! Dust, oxygen and just a spark from static electricity can destroy buildings!</b></u></mark> Just for example: In British columbia Canada in recent years there have been 2 sawmills that have suffered catastrophic explosions and fire that have claimed lives as a result of concentrated dust in the air. I do not know of the source of ignition but quite probably a spark was the reason.</p>
            <p>There are 2 methods of grounding plastic pipe, one method is to run a bare wire through the system and connect it to the metal chassis of the collector providing it has a grounded electrical connection, or the wire can be grounded to the electrical box. <u>This method presents a couple of problems:</u> Running a wire through the pipe is difficult especially if there are elbows and, or if the pipe is of significant length. It can catch on joints in the pipe and can also catch large wood chips causing clogs.</p>
            <p>I prefer to wind the wire in large loops tightly around the outside of the pipe. This allows the pipe to be taken apart if necessary and static electricity passes easily through the pipe to the ground wire. Gluing the pipe joints is not necessary since it is a friction fit, however you may want to drill a small pilot hole or two through the flange and insert 1/2" screws just to secure any joints subject to movement. The tips of short screws will barely penetrate through 2 layers of the pipe and so will not cause any obstruction. Again, you will want to ground the wire as stated above. As mentioned previously: I simply use PVC caps to close off unused ports. I run the ground wire to the end of each branch of the pipe.</p>
            <p>Now we come to smooth wall pipe VS: flex or accordian style pipe. There are several types of pipe or duct you could use for dust collection: smooth wall rigid PVC, metal pipe such as heating duct, flex or accordian duct that has a wire winding sealed in the plastic or dryer duct which is also wire wound. 1st off I do not recommend dryer duct, the plastic is too thin and perforates easily. Secondly: any flex duct reduces air flow by way of baffling or turbulence. Smooth air flow is what you want! 4" flex duct causes airflow loss of roughly 10 to 12CFM per foot due to the ridges in the pipe.</p>
            <p>Smooth wall pipe or duct is the most efficiant, the only consideration being PVC or any plastic pipe MUST be grounded from end to end whereas metal duct only has to be connected directly to the metal collector body. If a plastic manifold is used at the blower end, a short jumper wire can be connected from the metal duct to the collector chassis or power supply ground. I don't really have a problem with metal ducting other than sharp edges and possible particle traps at joints. I like PVC drainage pipe because it is easy to work with. One end has a flange that accepts the straight end and which makes an air-tight connection. PVC is easily cut to custom lengths with a mitre saw, couplers are available when there are no flanges. There are a variety of elbows, caps, and sanitary "Y"'s available.</p>
            <p>It is worth noting:the more elbows you use, the more air flow loss that will occur. "T" joints are especially bad for causing flow loss. If at all possible, use a "Y" or "sanitary Y" where necessary. If your dust collector has a 4" port at the blower (most do until you get to huge commercial machines), there is no benifit in going to larger duct, it will NOT increase your CFM simply because the air flow is limited by the smallest diameter adaptor or length of duct in the system. Obviously the same thing applies to reducing below 4", any smaller port, adaptor or duct will restrict your air flow. It is the same principal as squeezing a water hose; the water may appear to come out faster but you get less volume. 4" duct is a good size for the home or small shop application. I have worked in a couple of cabinet shops and even with much larger equipment, the dust ports are usually 4". In these cases, 6" ducts are often used like manifolds but are reduced. By comparison I have not found any advantage to adding in a cyclone system in a small shop situation. What I have observed is that sawdust tends to swirl as it enters the collector since there is a baffle inside the collector rim that causes rotation of incoming material.</p>
            <p>Dust collectors tend to be noisy creatures, if you enclose yours in any kind of cabinet, (insulation helps to reduce the noise) be sure to vent the cabinet otherwise you will lose a LOT of air flow! Air in must equal air out! As I mentioned earlier, there are plastic collector bags available now for the bottom application. These are largely for the convenience of curb-side disposal. Don't forget: plastic bags don't breathe and so will reduce your air flow somewhat.</p>
            <p><mark>Two last safety notes: it is possible for wet sawdust, especially from green wood to spontaniously combust in your collector bag. Other than lathe work, green wood tends to bind when sawn, this is dangerous!</mark></p>

            <h3 id="Air Filtration">Air Filtration</h3>
            <p>On the topic of dust control, one thing that is fairly important in a closed space or even a fairly large shop is air filtration. Your dust collector cannot collect every last particle, and having fine particles in suspension (in the shop air) is not only dangerous in enough concentration (explosion hazard) but it is also unhealthy! You don't have to be a coal miner to get lung damage or cancer. <mark>Dust particles of any kind from about 6 microns and smaller are the ones that can cause health problems.</mark> Larger particles are normally trapped by nose hair or are expelled as phlegm. <mark>6 microns or smaller are the ones that make it into your lungs and tend to stay there. This can lead to polyps, tumors, cancer, or in the case of certain exotic materials can be toxic or poisonous!</mark></p>
            <p>Some types of wood including exotic hardwoods and even Cedar can be anywhere from mild irritants to outright poisonous (enough to kill you!) A case in point: I have a neighbor who is a carver, he has developed severe allergies to certain woods and nearly died from a tiny sliver of exotic wood. Had it not been from quick action of a paramedic rescue team only a block away, and the fact they were aware of his allergies plus the fact they were able to get him to emergency care in minutes, he would have died. I believe if I remember right the effect was Anaphylactic shock.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of links to information on <b>Wood Toxins:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://www.wood-database.com/wood-articles/wood-alergies-and-toxicity/">Wood Alergies and Toxicity</a></li>

                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>There are numerous types and sizes of factory made air filtration systems available: Ceiling mounted or floor mounted. Most use accordian style filters and some use electrostatic systems also. The shop air simply circulates through the filter so many times per minute depending on the CFM of the blower inside the chassis. Dusty air goes in one end, through the filter which traps the dust, and exits as clean air. There is no need for the air to exit the shop which would cause heat loss in colder climates. You can build a fairly efficient system yourself using 1 or more furnace filters and a squirrel cage fan such as a furnace fan. The better the filter, the better the dust control. You can also build a dual purpose system that serves as air filtration as well as a down-draft sanding station.</p>
            <p>I used a belt-drive furnace fan that is rated at better than 500CFM. I placed it in a plywood box leaving room on either side of the fan for air flow as well as access to the belt. The air exits through an opening on one side of the box. On a narrow ledge above the fan I placed a high quality, electrostatic filter. The top slides open to access the filter for cleaning and also to periodically clean out the fan. I simply open the shop door, turn on the fan, and with the filter removed, blow out any dust collected in the fan with compressed air. Once or twice a year I also lube the fan and motor bearings especially if I have used the unit frequently.</p>
            <p> The fan connects to an external, switched plug mounted in a junction box with extra sockets also switched so I cannot run a hand sander without turning on the fan.</p>
            <p>The lid of the filter system has a piece of industrial rubber belting glued to 3/4" plywood. I had an acquaintance lay out a grid of 3/4" holes spaced 3" apart center to center using a CNC router. We cut the holes in the belting with a 3/4" hole punch. The belting is glued upside down which gives a smooth anti-slip surface which enables me in most cases to not have to hold the work piece while sanding.</p>
            <p>Occasionally I give the surface a quick cleanup with my randon-orbit sander using about a 120G disc to remove any glazing that occurs from time to time. It also refreshes the rubber surface without damage. I have been using the same rubber surface for 12 years and it is still going strong as is the motor which was old to begin with!</p>
            <p>In cases where I am creating a lot of fine dust with other tools, I slide the top of the filter system open to increase air flow. It is amazing how much dust the system removes from the air and how often I have to clean the air filter which I usually do with compressed air. Occasionally I give the filter a further cleaning with a good hand spray of water followed by drying with compressed air and/or by leaving the fan on for a while without creating any dust.</p>
            <p>In summer the I use the filter system to cool my shop simply by circulating the air. I didn't build the system for looks, rather for economy and functionality. The box is on steerable, lockable castors so I can move it easily.</p>
            
            <h3 id="Hand Planes">Hand Planes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>There are many kinds of hand planes, each designed for specific work. Jack planes with the longest sole for edge truing and flattening rough wood.</li>
                <li>Smoothing planes for general purpose work. These two are sometimes referred to as "bench" planes.</li>
                <li>Block planes for smoothing end grain.</li>
                <li>Jointer planes, as the name suggests are for joinery.</li>
                <li>Spoke shaves for round work such as spindles.</li>
                <li>Plough planes &amp; rabbet planes for grooves, rabbets and tongue &amp; groove joints.</li>
                <li>Molding planes, instrument planes for luthiers, and the list goes on. These and many others are still available for the purist but in many cases have been replaced by power tools and accessories such as routers, router bits, shapers, stationery joiners, power planes, etc. I do own a few of these but I neither have the money to invest in a wide variety of hand planes and I don't have the time to use them except on the odd occasion.</li>
                <li>Yes, an experienced workman can turn out beautiful work with hand tools such as these, but if you want to make serious money, a good, sharp power tool can get the job done faster (with experience). Using hand planes also takes some practice and know how. Knowing how to use them correctly, and knowing how to sharpen them. These two are essential to hand plane use if you want to turn out fine work! The article on plane knives and chisels covers the basics of maintenance.</li>
                <li>If you desire to be a purist and plan to use mainly hand tools, it is worth checking out estate sales, garage sales, flee markets, retirement sales and so on. There are a few makers of good hand tools such as planes but as mentioned in the chisel article: Planes and chisels made in the 18 &amp; early 1900's were often made with laminated blades which were of better quality than most modern versions. They held an edge longer and cut cleaner. I learned this from a senior English cabinet maker who really knew his tools!</li>
                <li>Since the majority of our tools including power tools come from Asia and other parts of the world where labor is cheap, so the quality tends to be also. In some cases these countries have made advances in quality but one must have a discerning eye. Look for signs of quality or lack of in the construction of import tools. How rugged is it? Is there a lot of plastic in it? Are the metal parts made of steel, cast iron, aluminum or pot metal? What is the amperage of a power tool you are looking at? (don't forget to read up on the subject of horse power, what is real and what is slick sales technique) If you REALLY want to know what a particular power tool really puts out for HP as opposed to what the label or the vendor suggests, get a copy of "Pocket Ref" by T.J. Glover (should be available at your local library or book store) or you can go on-line. The 2nd edition has specs. for 115volt, 60Hz, single phase electric motors (for 220-230v, simply divide the amp rating by 2) See P.123 in the pocket ref. Here is a link with a converter that does the math for you: <a href="http://www.onlineconversion.com/motor_horsepower.htm/">Motor Horse-power</a></li>

            <h3 id="Thickness Planers">Thickness Planers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Thickness planers do exactly what the name implies. They reduce the thickness of wood as it passes through the planer. What they <b>do not do</b> is straighten twisted wood, that is the job of a joiner or even a good table saw.</li>
                <li>If you run a piece of warped or twisted wood through a thickness planer, what you will get is a thinner piece of warped or twisted wood! These planers also have a tendency to <b>snipe</b> one end of your wood. What happens is: there are rubber feed rollers on the in-feed and out-feed ends of the planer with the planer drum which contains the blades being in the middle. As the wood feeds through the planer it tends to come out with about a 3" or 4" of "snipe" on one end caused by the wood lifting as it passes under the rollers as it enters or exits the planer. It seems no matter how much you try adjusting your in-feed and out-feed tables to eliminate snipe there will always be some. I have even experimented with add-on tables but again with little success. It seems the only solution is to allow about 4 extra inches of waste material which you cut off after you have reached the desired thickness.</li>
                <li>As for setting up your in-feed &amp; out-feed tables, I suggest using a straight-edge. Adjust the tables until there is no gap between the straight-edge and the in-feed, out-feed and main bed of the planer.</li>
                <li>It is important to determine the direction of grain of the lumber to the direction of feed in order to achieve the best job. If you feed the lumber in the wrong direction you can get "tear-out" where the blades grab the edge of the grain, lifting and tearing out pieces. This is especially true with flat sawn lumber which is mostly what you will get at your local lumber supplier. More on flat, rift, and quarter sawn lumber in <b>"Wood Tips"</b></li>
                <li>Keep an eye on the quality of the cut your planer is producing. If you see ridges, you probably need to have your blades sharpened. If your planer burns the lumber or seems to be working too hard, possibly you either have the cut set too deep or your blades may be dull. Unless you are a pro at it and have the right gear, I do not suggest you try sharpening your blades yourself. This <b>must</b> be a very precise operation. Installing the blades requires precision you can only get with a proper, good quality installation jig. I prefer a magnetic installation tool rather than what usually comes with your planer. Planer blades are as sharp as surgical knives, you can get really nasty cuts if you are not careful when handling them. Any tool for cutting or planing lumber needs to be <b>sharp</b>!</li>
                <li>Keep your planer clean of sawdust and wood resin. Be extra careful when cleaning the blades! I would recommend using an old toothbrush with the same cleaners mentioned for saw blades. Using a rag is inviting cuts. Your planer tables can also benifit from cleaning occasionally to reduce drag on the lumber which in turn can cause burning. Over heating your planer knives (saw blades incl.) can ruin them! Carbides on any cutting tool do not like excessive heat!</li>
                <li>Keep the chain and adjusting screws free of sawdust to prevent binding or damage.</li>
                <li>Thickness planers create a <b>LOT</b> of shavings, if you have a dust collector you can generally connect to the planer with either a factory or home-made dust port. My planer has a gap between the dust port and planer body, in order to make dust extraction more efficient I added a piece of sheet acrylic of about 3/16" or 1/4" thick to cover the gap. This keeps shavings from escaping past the collector port. I admit it is not fancy but it works. The acrylic strip is held in place by a wing nut on one end while the opposite end is secured with a small stud and a sheet metal screw. The tin on the ends while crude, also prevents the escape o shavings. Under the "Y" port there is a piece of aluminum angle fastened to the bottom of the planer and dust port. The screws are short enough so as not to affect the workings of the planer.</li>

                <li>I usually blow out any remaining dust or shavings after running the planer. I use a 4"-90 Deg. PVC elbow attached to the port and turned to one side so it does not interfere with the lumber being planed. The planer sits on a rolling cabinet with wheel brakes. You will notice I don't caulk around the dust port or the piece of acrylic, this is so I can remove them for periodic servicing of the blades and other mechanisms.</li>
                <li>When you plane very thin pieces of lumber, there is less air flow through the planer which is also why I try to keep any unnecessary holes plugged so as to increase air flow where it is needed. Since not all thickness planers have exactly the same design for dust collection, you will have to be inventive towards effecient dust control. If you have a plastics vendor in your area you may be able to purchase small pieces of sheet acrylic for shop use. It is very handy when modifying tools and can be drilled, cut on a band saw, scroll saw, jig saw or table saw (using a good plywood blade or mitre saw blade) it can also be glued with IPS Weld-On # 16 clear, medium bodied Acrylic solvent cement.</li>

            <h3 id="Thickness or Panel Sanders">Thickness or Panel Sanders</h3>
            <p>Thickness or panel sanders operate similarly to thickness planers: you have in &amp; out-feed rollers and either a drum or belt sanding surface. One misconception is that thiskness sanders can remove the same amount of material per pass as a thickness planer. <b>NOT SO!</b> They are designed to just remove surface imperfections and that is all! Too much pressure on a thickness sander can either stall the unit or burn the lumber. Small home owner or small shop panel sanders are manually adjusted whereas larger commercial units are more likely to be pneumatically adjusted requiring the operator to "dial in" or digitally set the desired thickness and the machine does the rest when started.</p>
            
            
            <h3 id="Lathes">Lathes</h3>
            <p>Most of what I have to say about wood turning concerns safety.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rule #1: Take some lessons before you try turning on your own! Handled improperly, even a small lathe can be a very dangerous tool!</li>
                <li>Choosing the correct speed for turning any given piece of wood is not a matter of "by guess &amp; by gosh", it requires some basic knowledge!</li>
                <li>Knowing what tool or tools to use, when and where is also essential. The wrong tool can cause injury.</li>
                <li>Using tools that are properly sharpened is VERY important. The bevel angle needs to be kept to within a degree or two of precise known angles otherwise the tool will either not cut properly or may kick back and can cause very serious injury and perhaps a ruined tool!</li>
                <li>Rounding back the corners of your gouges can reduce the tendency to "catch" or dig in which can lead to injury and damaged equipment. I once had a kick-back while using my big roughing gouge, it flew over my shoulder and landed on the floor. I was fortunate the only result was a dulled cutting edge! Roughing gouges, top &amp; bottom edges.</li>
                <li> A skew, note the edge is curved slightly so that the tool can be moved in an arc without catching as easily. </li>
                <li>A dull tool can cause injury, the reason in part is because of using excessive force to produce the cutting action. This can cause the tool to slip or catch and kick back! Note that while turning tools must be kept sharp, they do not need to be honed to a mirror finish like carving tools or general wood working chisels. Depending on the wood species you are turning and the quality of your tools, you may need to touch up the edges frequently while in use. ASP 2060 High Speed steel will hold an edge longer than softer steel thus reducing the need for sharpening.</li>
                <li>How you hold your tools, body stance the height of the tool rest and distance from the work piece as well as the angle the tool is held at are all very important!</li>
                <li>I suggest wearing a turning smock which is designed for safety: The sleeves have elastic cuffs and is held closed with velcro tabs (hook &amp; loop) so that if the smock were to get caught in the spinning lathe or the work piece it can tear free to avoid injury. The collar also wraps around your neck so as to keep out Irritating wood particles. I wouldn't be without one!</li>
                <li>I highly recommend a full face shield instead of safety glasses. This is why:

                    This piece of hardwood which has a razor sharp point and an edge sharp enough to cut flesh came off a bowl that I was turning. At high velocity, it hit my face shield above my eyes and had I only been wearing safety glasses or goggles it would certainly have caused serious injury or perhaps even death! This sort of thing is nothing to be trifled with, when you have a piece of wood spinning at perhaps 1500 to 2000RPM, something of this size coming off the lathe can strike with the force of a hammer blow! The only time I don't wear a face shield is when I am sanding at low speed, 500 RPM or less.
                </li>
                <li>While it is cumbersome especially with eye glasses, I wear a respirator to keep from breathing fine dust. Since it is difficult to confine dust from a lathe, the dust collector can only pick up so just so much. Some dust inevitably escapes. Remember: it's the really fine dust that can cause allergic reactions or worse. Some people can be sensitized from exposure to dust from certain species of wood which can lead to severe reactions, even death! (see the links to Wood Toxins) I don't promote the use of those cheap cotton face masks or even the ones that are supposed to be HEPA filters, They simply don't seal tight enough around your face to prevent fine dust inhalation whereas a respirator that has a rubber face dam can if the straps are properly adjusted. A respirator has a filter or filters for organic vapors &amp; other fumes depending on the cartridge. They also have primary cotton dust filters in front of the cartridge. I made my living for years as a drywaller and discovered in short order that the cheap cotton face masks were allowing me to breathe drywall dust as was evident by the white powder which always collected around my nose.</li>
                <li>When turning an odd shaped piece of wood, the lathe canbecome unballanced. It is essential if you are starting with such a piece that your latheis securely fastened to the floor or weighed down.</li>
                <li>Keep your belt guards in place,Spinning belts & pulleys can remove fingers!</li>
                <li>Your tool rest should be kept within 1/4" of your work piece to prevent your tools from being grabbed by the spinning wood. That can cause the tool to flip up out of your hands and if the tool hits your face... it's going to HURT! Naturally you will have to adjust the height & angle of the tool rest from time to time as your piece progresses and of course when starting with a rough piece of wood, the 1/4" space is determined by the highest point in the piece. To mark the center of a bowl blank, there are handy store-bought guides for marking the center point. They are cheap but SO handy! They work fine also with square or multi-sided blanks. There are also occasions when you may want an off-center starting point for your live or spurr center. I will attempt to elaborate later in "Woodworking Tips".</li>
                <li>There are "S" shaped tool rests available for deep turning in bowls. This allows the rest to be angled inside the bowl for safer turning and reduced chatter.</li>
                <li>There are several assessory tools that make wood turning a more enjoyable experience: Calipers for checking the diameter of spindles, candle sticks or other items. Thickness calipers for checking the thickness of bowl walls, Compasses, depth gauges and more. It goes without saying the last thing you want is to blow out the bottom of a bowl by turning too deep...depth gauges and thickness gauges can be shop-made if you like or you can buy factory made ones. The cost is fairly nominal. I made my own thickness gauges from sheet acrylic as my usual supplier did not have any available when I needed them. Essentially they are composed of 2-"S" shaped halves that are assembled to form a figure 8 with a pivot point in the center. The 2 halves should be identical so that the "business end" indicates the bowl wall thickness on the opposite end. 1/8" acrylic will do. Care must be taken when drilling the acrylic so as not to crack it. Use a drill press on low speed if you have one. As for checking depth of a bowl, all you need is a pointed piece of dowel or even the rod you use to remove the spur centre.</li>
                <li>Lighting is a consideration: when turning a deep bowl I like to have the light directed into the bowl (not in my eyes). Turning is a visual experience, light is important.</li>
                <li>Most often I hold my tools with bare hands but I must admit there are times when the shavings can get hot enough to be rather painful. I think a pair of snug fitting but fairly thin leather gloves (kid leather, deer skin...) may be OK at times. The important thing is you don't want bulkey or loose fitting gloves. There are also fabric gloves designed to give a good grip while protecting your hands. Control is very important.</li>

            <h3 id="Drill Presses">Drill Presses</h3>
            <p>Drill presses come in a variety of sizes and styles. Some are bench mount which are mainly home owner hobby drill presses for small work. Then there are floor mount units which are capable of larger work, larger size drill bits, and have more power. Of the floor mount drill presses, some are even capable of horizontal drilling. Most drill presses are belt drive until you get up into industrial units. Some, even small bench mount units are direct drive with electronic speed control. There are also some that have reverse.</p>
            <p>For the most part a belt drive drill press is fine for the home DIY'er, hobby use, or small home enterprise user. My 1st drill press was a bench top unit which I quickly found out just didn't suit my needs. It not only lacked the power needed to turn larger bits, but the diameter of the work pieces dictated the need for a larger unit. As always, I suggest buying the best you can afford. If you are a serious wood worker, whether a hobbiest or small shop owner who wants to produce goods for sale, I strongly suggest a good quality floor mount drill press with good bit to post clearance. The distance between the bit and post determines the size of the drill press, IE: a 14" unit has 14" between the bit &amp; post. With floor units you should be able to fit a 5/8" chuck by changing the Morris Taper that adapts the chuck to the spindle or arbor as it is also called.</p>
            <p>If the drill press already comes with a 5/8" chuck, there is no need to go there. Bigger is always better if you need to use large diameter bits especially like Forstner bits that come in sizes from 1/4" to 3" diameter or larger. The larger ones will need a 5/8" chuck. These are not bits to try using with a hand drill unless you want a broken arm! <b>Power (not speed) is essential for turning large bits. In fact, the larger the diameter of the bit, the slower the speed should be to prevent burning of both bit and material not to mention damage or injury!</b> Forstner bits are very handy in wood working not only because of size but because you can drill smooth, flat bottom blind holes. If you do want to through-drill with these bits or any bit for that matter, you should always have a sacrificial piece of wood under the work piece so as to prevent tear-out on the bottom of the piece being drilled, and to protect the drill bit and drill press table. Shop scrap like plywood cut-offs or lumber cut-offs come in handy for this and are disposable when they lack a flat surface.</p>
            <p>I added a plywood top to my drill press table as I found the factory cast unit was too small to accommodate large work pieces, I also often use a machinists drill press vice if I am drilling a difficult piece of material or in the case of metal or plastics. With the add-on table top I can speed clamp the vice exactly where I need it. I have customised my drill press in several other ways also: I added a rolling base with steerable, locking wheels, great for small work space. Also, I added a foot switch which is great when I need both hands on the work. I fastened a duplex electrical box to the base where I plug in both the drill press and a magnetic work light. I keep a few small basic drill bits on a magnet attached to the belt cover along with the chuck key. Any time I use high speed drill bits, I first drill a pilot hole to keep the larger bits centered.</p>
            <p>If you need to drill at an angle the table can be tilted. There is a gauge that indicates the degree of tilt but I suggest checking it with a protractor in case it is not accurate. The indicator should be adjustable. It is also a good idea to check the alignment of the bit to the table. A machinists square is placed on the table and against the bit to ensure 90 Deg. alignment. (side to side &amp; front to back). It's a good idea to check this often if your drill press gets a lot of use or gets moved around a lot.</p>
            <p>As for proper bit speeds, in your browser: check out the on-line PDF; "Drill Press Speed Chart-Fermilab/Home. They have an excellent chart that includes many types of drill bits.</p>
            <p>As with band saws, adding a larger table to your drill press does help support larger work pieces <i>but does not increase the capacity between the bit &amp; post.</i></p>

            <h3 id="Shim It">Shim It</h3>
            <p>Don't throw away those old CD's or DVD's. I recently had to do some hand held routing where my router had to sit on a very narrow strip of wood while I edge trimmed the work piece. Behind the strip was a flat surface slightly lower than what my router had to sit on. I needed something to slip under the router base to make it sit flat, that's when I spied an old CD that was no longer usable. I cut it in half on my band saw and taped the 2 pieces to the the half of the router base that needed shimming. It perfectly leveled out the router. A cheap but effective fix!</p>
            
            
            <h3 id="Glue Applicator Holders">Glue Applicator Holders</h3>
            <p>Here's one from the wood box: while gluing up a cracked mirror frame I had to set my glue applicator down for a minute. I like to get the most out of even my disposable items. C/A glue applicators will last a number of uses if you can keep the tip clear of glue. Laying one down on a flat surface allows the tip to clog and harden up quickly. Usually I look for something to rest them on between applications but most often they roll off and may also stick to what ever they land on. I happened to have a scrap of wood with a 1/4"x1/4" slot in it in my scrap box, it served perfectly for an applicator holder keeping the tip raised so any remaining glue drains into the bulb instead of collecting at the business end and hardening. Cheap trix, Disposable when it's gummed up, gotta love it!</p>
