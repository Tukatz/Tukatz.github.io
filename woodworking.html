        <p>I don't claim to know it all or to have all the best advice on the subjects of wood working, tool care and set-up. My aim is merely to pass on what I have learned over the years and what has worked for me.</p>
        <p>My first experience with wood working was in my father's little boat building shop. It wasn't fancy, neither were his tools but he managed to turn out a number of small boats before he retired from that line of work. By that time I was only in primary school so my hands-on experience in the shop was very minimal but I none the less managed to remember a few things for later reference.</p>
        <p>In later years I spent a good deal of my working life in construction and building restoration where I had to learn a variety of skills including that of wood working. For a period of time I also sold wood working tools which added to my base knowledge of stationary tools, hand and power tools. Here and there I have picked up tips from associates.</p>
        <p>In earlier years I wish I had had access to some of the information I have included in this site as it would have advanced my ability and knowledge of tools, thus I have put together some of what I have learned in hopes it may help the novice or even someone experienced, with a different slant on processes.</p>
        <p> As of this time I have not received tips from other wood workers to pass on but I hope as time passes to be able to include even more information from other folks.</p>
